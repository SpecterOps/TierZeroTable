Account Operators;DC group;Active Directory;SID: S-1-5-32-548;The Account Operators group grants limited account creation privileges to a user. Members of this group can create and modify most types of accounts, including accounts for users, Local groups, and Global groups. Group members can log in locally to domain controllers. Members of the Account Operators group can't manage the Administrator user account, the user accounts of administrators, or the Administrators, Server Operators, Account Operators, Backup Operators, or Print Operators groups. Members of this group can't modify user rights. The Account Operators group applies to the Windows Server operating system in the Default Active Directory security groups list. Note: By default, this built-in group has no members. The group can create and manage users and groups in the domain, including its own membership and that of the Server Operators group. This group is considered a service administrator group because it can modify Server Operators, which in turn can modify domain controller settings. As a best practice, leave the membership of this group empty, and don't use it for any delegated administration. This group can't be renamed, deleted, or removed.;YES - Takeover;N/A - Compromise by default;YES;The Account Operators group has GenericAll in the default security descriptor on the AD object classes: User, Group, and Computer. That means all objects of these types will be under full control of Account Operators unless they are protected with AdminSDHolder. Not all Tier Zero objects will be protected with AdminSDHolder typically, as not all Tier Zero objects will be included in Protected Accounts and Groups. This means Account Operators members have a path to compromise Tier Zero most often. It is possible to delete all GenericAll ACEs for Account Operators on Tier Zero objects. To protect future Tier Zero objects, one would have to either remove the Account Operators ACE from the default security descriptors or implement a process of removing the ACEs as Tier Zero objects are being created. However, we recommend not using the group and classifying it as Tier Zero instead.;YES;YES;1;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-security-groups#account-operators, https://www.whiteoaksecurity.com/blog/account-operators-privilege-escalation/,

Administrator;AD user;Active Directory;SID: S-1-5-21-<domain>-500;The Administrator account is a default account that is used in all versions of the Windows operating system on every computer and device. The Administrator account is used by the system administrator for tasks that require administrative credentials.
